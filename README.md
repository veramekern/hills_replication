# hills-experiment-thesis

This is the full experiment we use in my thesis written at Leiden University.
The task is based on two earlier studied by Hills, Todd, & Goldstone (2008, 2010; See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18816288 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21038983 respectively).
