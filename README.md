# hills-experiment-replication

This is the full experiment we to replicate earlier studies by Hills, Todd, & Goldstone (2008, 2010; See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18816288 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21038983 respectively).

These are all scripts necessary and main.sh is a bash script that calls the python scripts in the correct order. 
Make sure there is a folder 'images' to contain all images.
